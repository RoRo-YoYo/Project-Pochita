# ✏️ Design Evolution & Concept Art

**Project:** Project Pochita

**Phase:** 🧠 Conceptualization & Mechanical Strategy

This document serves as the visual engineering notebook, tracking the evolution from rough napkin sketches to parametric CAD models.

## 🏗️ 1. The "Internal Skeleton" (Rough Sketches)
*Initial brainstorming on how to fit rigid mechanics into a soft body.*

| Concept Sketch | Engineering Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| <img src="images/General.png" width="400"> | **Side View Layout**<br>Decided to place the battery pack near the stomach act as a counterweight.<br><br>The motor must sit *low* in the belly to prevent the plushie from tipping over when it vibrates. |

## 🪚 2. Chainsaw Mechanism (Drive System)

## 🎮 3. The Pull-Cord Trigger (Haptics)
*Mechanical logic for the "Revving" interaction.*

  <em>Figure 3: Logic flow for the Badge Reel + Limit Switch interaction.</em>
</div>

* **The Problem:** The limit switch needs to trigger *only* when the cord is pulled, but the string is too thin to hit the button.
* **The Solution:** Added a "Stopper Bead" that physically crashes into the roller arm when retracted.

## 🔌 4. Circuit & Wiring Diagrams
*No microcontroller. Pure analog H-Bridge logic.*

## 🧩 5. Assembly & "Exploded" Views
*How it all screws together (Design for Assembly).*
